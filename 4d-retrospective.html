        <h1>4D Perspective Rendering — A Retrospective</h1>

        <p>The idea of higher dimensions is naturally intriguing. To reach beyond the three dimensions our universe
            provides, and explore a world that could exist, but doesn't.</p>

        <!-- ... mathematics -->
        <p>For really high dimensions, that's the only approach. But down in four dimensions, we want more. We want to
            see it. Experience it. Hence, a video game.</p>

        <h2>Rendering in 4D</h2>

        <p>But what does that look like? How do we take a four-dimensional world, and put it on a two-dimensional
            screen?</p>

        <p>The most common approach is to <em>slice</em> the four-dimensional world, and render only a three-dimensional
            piece of it. This is the approach taken by the games <a href="https://miegakure.com/">Miegakure</a> and <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147950/4D_Golf/">4D Golf</a>.</p>

        <p>This works well. I can't speak for Miegakure, but 4D Golf is surprisingly intuitive.</p>

        <p>But this approach also comes with downsides. Most importantly, you can only see a small section of the 4D
            world at once. Essentially, you have no peripheral vision. This limits your ability to fully understand the
            space you're in.</p>

        <p>So let's consider an alternative.</p>

        <h2>Perspective Rendering</h2>

        <p>In an ordinary, 3D game, the three-dimensional world is rendered onto a two-dimensional screen. But the math
            involved generalizes perfectly. So a <em>four</em>-dimensional world can be rendered onto a
            <em>three</em>-dimensional screen.
        </p>

        <p>This approach is commonly seen when you look at pictures of mathematical objects like tesseracts. But it's
            also the approach taken by <a href="https://www.urticator.net/maze/">this maze game</a>.</p>

        <p>The game certainly takes some getting used to. But once I did, it was a real revelation when I first saw four
            mutually-perpendicular passageways at the same time.</p>

        <p>But this game has problems. In particular, I really don't like the "line art" drawing style, where only the
            edges of shapes are drawn.</p>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>

        <p>My goal was to make a four-dimensional game, using perspective rendering, that does not render everything as
            line art.</p>

        <p>After many tries, over a number of years, I have declared this project a failure. Let's see what went wrong.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Difficulties</h2>

        <p>Rendering proceeds in two steps: projecting from 4D to 3D, then from 3D to 2D. Interestingly, it's the second
            that causes problems.</p>

        <p>Think about the result of rendering an ordinary 3D scene. The screen ends up divided into a number of colored
            or textured regions. If you're looking down a hallway, the rendered image contains a square depicting the
            far end of the hallway, surrounded by four trapezoids depicting the walls.</p>

        <svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-1 -1 2 2">
            <polygon fill="#707070" points="-0.222,-0.222 -0.222,0.222 0.222,0.222 0.222,-0.222" />
            <polygon fill="#808080" points="-0.222,-0.222 -0.222,0.222 -1,1 -1,-1" />
            <polygon fill="#a0a060" points="-0.222,-0.222 0.222,-0.222 1,-1 -1,-1" />
            <polygon fill="#808080" points="0.222,-0.222 0.222,0.222 1,1 1,-1" />
            <polygon fill="#6060a0" points="-0.222,0.222 0.222,0.222 1,1 -1,1" />
            <polyline points="-0.667,-0.667 -0.667,0.667 0.667,0.667 0.667,-0.667 -0.667,-0.667" fill="none"
                stroke="#404040" stroke-width="0.005" />
            <polyline points="-0.4,-0.4 -0.4,0.4 0.4,0.4 0.4,-0.4 -0.4,-0.4" fill="none" stroke="#404040"
                stroke-width="0.005" />
            <polyline points="-0.286,-0.286 -0.286,0.286 0.286,0.286 0.286,-0.286 -0.286,-0.286" fill="none"
                stroke="#404040" stroke-width="0.005" />
        </svg>

        <p>So if you render a 4D scene, you end up with a 3D screen, divided into colored or textured sections. Such a
            thing isn't exactly easy to draw.</p>

        <p>First of all, the user needs to be able to see the entire 3D screen. So when we project from 3D to 2D, we
            can't
            make anything opaque. <em>Everything</em> should be partially transparent, either through opacity or leaving
            holes to look through.</p>

        <p>To make things worse, the colored regions are <em>volumes</em> in the 3D screen. So we need a fog effect.
            Rendering this isn't really the problem — it's just hard to interpret the layers of fog once rendered.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, we could render only the bounding faces between the volumes. But then it's not clear how to
            color them. I tried just taking the color of the region behind, but that didn't work well. I suppose we
            could give up on color entirely, but that doesn't seem great either.</p>

        <h2>Implementation Difficulties</h2>

        TODO

        <!-- <p>But these design difficulties pale in comparison to the problems I had <em>implementing</em> the renderer.</p> -->

        <h3>Partial Solution</h3>

        TODO
        <!-- TODO: This is fixed by restricting camera movement. E.g. isometric games, or games like FEZ. -->
