        <h1>Thoughts on Noncommutative Synthetic Differential Geometry</h1>

        <h2>What is SDG?</h2>

        <p><dfn>Synthetic Differential Geometry</dfn> is the study of constructive logic augmented with, at minimum, the
            following axioms.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>\(R\) is a ring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Let \(D = \{x \in R \mid x^2=0\}\). Then the linear map \(R^2 \to (D \to R)\) given by \((a,b)
                    \mapsto (x
                    \mapsto a+bx)\) is
                    invertible.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These axioms make it trivial to build up many of the common concepts from calculus. For instance, the inverse
            of
            \((a,b) \mapsto (x \mapsto a+bx)\) acts as the function \(f \mapsto (f(0), f'(0))\). And suddenly we have
            derivatives.</p>

        <p>Other concepts are just as easy. The tangent bundle to a manifold \(M\) is simply the type \(D \to M\).
            Literally
            an infinitesimal curve in the manifold!</p>

        <p>These ideas are explored in far more depth in <a href="https://users-math.au.dk/kock/sdg99.pdf">these</a> <a
                href="https://tildeweb.au.dk/au76680/SGM-final.pdf">books</a> by Anders Kock.</p>

        <h2>Topos Models</h2>

        TODO: Introduce alternate perspective: SDG is the study of toposes similar to the classifying topos of
        commutative
        local rings.

        <h2>A Noncommutative Version?</h2>

        <p>To me, this raises an obvious question. What if we instead look at the classifying topos of
            <em>noncommutative</em> local rings?
        </p>

        <p>Let's try it.</p>

        <p>The first thing to note is that this classifying topos is a <dfn>monoidal topos</dfn>. In addition to
            the cartesian product and coproduct, it has another, equally important monoidal structure.</p>

        <p>We could try to simply axiomatize this monoidal product, but that's awkward. Better to build it into our
            ambient logic, such as is done in <a href="https://ulrichschoepp.de/Docs/th.pdf">this thesis by Ulrich
                Schöpp</a>.</p>

        <p>But that paper is geared toward a very different topos. The Schanuel topos, which classifies infinite
            decidable
            objects. Does the type theory even apply here?</p>

        <p>Yes. Their type theory is far more general than their paper admits. It <a
                href="https://github.com/finegeometer/monoidal-classifying-topos/blob/main/paper.pdf">turns out</a> that
            there's a simple three-step process to model it in the classifying topos of an arbitrary theory.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>(Geometrically) define a binary relation \(\sim\) between each pair of sorts of your theory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the Schanuel topos, that's the apartness relation.</li>
                    <li>For the classifying topos of local rings, that's the "commutes" relation, \(x \sim y \iff xy =
                        yx\).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Check that \(x \sim y \iff y \sim x\).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fix any \(x\) in any sort of your theory. Check that, if you restrict each sort \(A\) to the subset
                    \(\{a
                    \in A \mid a \sim x\}\), you get a (sub)model of the same theory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the Schanuel topos, this says that removing one element of an infinite decidable object
                        yields
                        another infinite decidable object.</li>
                    <li>For the classifying topos of local rings, this says that for any \(x\) in a local ring \(R\),
                        the
                        centralizer \(C_R(\{x\})\) is still a local ring.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you can do that, you can interpret Schöpp's type theory in your topos.</p>
