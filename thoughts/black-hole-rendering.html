        <h1>Thoughts on Black Hole Rendering</h1>
        <p>To render a (non-rotating) black hole, it should suffice to know the relationship between the following four
            quantities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your distance from the black hole.</li>
            <li>How far the trajectory of the incoming light ray angles toward or away from the black hole.</li>
            <li>How far the ray has been deflected from its direction at t=-∞.</li>
            <li>How far the ray was offset from pointing directly at the black hole at t=-∞.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given two of these quantities, it should be possible to compute the other two. And while the computation
            might be
            annoying,
            the results could be precomputed and stored in a texture.</p>

        <p>How do you use this to render? First, you figure out where your ray came from. Then, once you know that, you
            back-calculate what might have intercepted the light ray.</p>
