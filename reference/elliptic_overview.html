        <h1>Overview of Elliptic Functions</h1>

        <p>This page describes the concept of elliptic functions.
            <a href="/reference/elliptic.html">Here's a reference/formula sheet.</a>
        </p>

        <p><dfn>Elliptic functions</dfn> are a class of functions, not part of the standard curriculum,
            that sometimes show up in the solutions to physics problems. I've seen them everywhere from
            gravitational fields in a toroidal universe, to the paths light takes around a black hole,
            to understanding a pendulum's motion <em>without</em> the typical small-angle approximation.
            They also have some beautiful behavior when viewed as functions on the <em>complex</em> numbers,
            rather than the reals.
        </p>

        <h2>Weierstrass ℘</h2>

        <p>The prototypical elliptic function is the <dfn>Weierstrass ℘ function</dfn>.
            It is a function from the complex plane to itself, parameterized by any one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A lattice, \(\Lambda \subset \mathbb{C}\). Think of a regular two-dimensional grid of points, sitting
                inside the complex plane.
            </li>
            <li>A pair of generators, \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\).</li>
            <li>The <dfn>Weierstrass invariants</dfn>, \(g_2\) and \(g_3\).</li>
            <li>The <dfn>half-periods</dfn>; an unordered triple \(e_1,e_2,e_3\), summing to zero.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The function is typically simply written as \(\wp(z)\), suppressing these parameters.</p>

        <p>The variety of parameterizations come from the two different fundamental aspects of ℘.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It's doubly periodic. That is, \(\wp(z) = \wp(z + \lambda)\) for any \(\lambda \in \Lambda\).
                    Equivalently, we have \(\wp(z) = \wp(z + \omega_1) = \wp(z + \omega_2)\),
                    where \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\) generate the lattice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It solves the differential equation \(y'^2 = 4y^3 + g_2 y + g_3\).
                    Equivalently, we can factor the cubic, yielding \(y'^2 = 4(y-e_1)(y-e_2)(y-e_3)\).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can relate these two aspects to each other. The \(e_i\) values are <em>half-periods</em>,
            in the sense that \(\{\wp(z) \mid 2z \in \Lambda\} = \{e_1,e_2,e_3,\infty\}\).
            Specifically, \(e_1 = \wp(\tfrac{\omega_1}{2})\), \(e_2 = \wp(\tfrac{\omega_2}{2})\),
            \(e_3 = \wp(\tfrac{\omega_1 + \omega_2}{2})\), and \(\infty = \wp(0)\).
        </p>

        <p>If using \(\wp\) here feels too circular, we can also calculate \(g_2\) and \(g_3\) directly.
            It turns out that \(g_2 = 60\sum\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda \setminus \{0\}} \lambda^{-4}\),
            and \(g_3 = 140\sum\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda \setminus \{0\}} \lambda^{-6}\).
        </p>

        <h2>Jacobi</h2>

        <p>But maybe your lattice is simply an axis-aligned grid of rectangles.
            In this case, it may be simpler to work with <dfn>Jacobi's elliptic functions</dfn>, instead of ℘.</p>

        <p>Jacobi's functions feel a lot like trigonometry.
            You have functions like \(\operatorname{sn}(x)\) and \(\operatorname{cn}(x)\),
            satisfying equations like \(\operatorname{sn}^2 + \operatorname{cn}^2 = 1\).</p>

        <p>But there are six common trig functions. For Jacobi's functions, there are <em>twelve</em>.</p>

        <p>It's not so bad, though. Just as the trig functions have plenty of redundancy
            (\(\operatorname{sec}\) is just \(\frac{1}{\sin}\)), so do Jacobi's functions.
            In fact, Jacobi's functions are probably <em>better</em> designed; they form a very clean pattern.
        </p>

        <p>The symbols are just every pair of letters taken from \(\{\mathrm{s},\mathrm{c},\mathrm{d},\mathrm{n}\}\).
            So you have functions like \(\operatorname{sn}(x)\) or \(\operatorname{cd}(x)\).
            Furthermore, products like \(\operatorname{cd} \operatorname{dn}\) simplify to \(\operatorname{cn}\),
            and functions like \(\operatorname{ss}\) simplify to \(1\).
        </p>

        <p>So you can get away with just \(\operatorname{sn}\), \(\operatorname{cn}\), and \(\operatorname{dn}\).
            Everything else is a shorthand, like \(\operatorname{cd}\) for
            \(\frac{\operatorname{cn}}{\operatorname{dn}}\).
            This is a lot like doing trigonometry with just \(\sin\) and \(\cos\),
            by rewriting \(\tan\) as \(\frac{\sin}{\cos}\).</p>

        <p>Just as ℘ was parameterized by either a lattice or a pair of invariants,
            Jacobi's functions are parameterized by a single number, \(m\).
            Or by its square root, \(k = \sqrt{m}\). So we typically write
            \(\operatorname{sn}(x,m)\) or \(\operatorname{sn}(x;k)\).</p>

        <h2>Other functions</h2>

        <p>There are various other relevant functions, which I won't go into here.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Elliptic Integrals: Show up as inverses to Jacobi's elliptic functions, or in computing their period.
            </li>
            <li>Jacobi Amplitude: A function satisfying
                \(\sin(\operatorname{am}(x)) = \operatorname{sn}(x)\),
                \(\cos(\operatorname{am}(x)) = \operatorname{cn}(x)\), and
                \(\frac{d}{dx}\operatorname{am}(x) = \operatorname{dn}(x)\),
            </li>
            <li>Jacobi epsilon, Weierstrass sigma and zeta, et cetera et cetera.
                Don't worry about them; they mostly show up when you integrate other elliptic functions.
            </li>
        </ul>
